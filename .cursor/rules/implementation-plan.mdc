# Implementation Plan - CollabX Core Functionalities

## Rules to adhere to:
   - Anytime we do a refactoring to use the common items from shared package, remove the redundant files from frontend or backend.
   - Do not change the UI layout or components if not absolutely needed.
   - Looks for existing implementation first and if not found then implement from scratch.
   - Cleanup redundant code if any along the way.
   - Make things easier wherever possible in the code
   - For each feature above, add existing or create new test cases after implementing the functionality.
   - Refer this plan and Do not break the previously implemented functionality.
   - Be very careful with refactoring just so we do not break anything existing.
